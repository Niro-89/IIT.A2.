		<h1>Individual Group Reflections</h1> </br> 
 
		<h3>Tessa </h3>
		<p>
		Tessa Riley’s reflection on how the team worked together focused on the ability to work as he went into this assignment with a fear of needing to do more than my fair share of the assignment, due to previous experiences. The group, however, divided up the tasks evenly and shared their work so that they could have a cohesive writing style. This was achieved by me going over the final work and making slight changes to the writing styles so that the piece flowed. 
		Unfortunately, there was a little mishap with meetings and some people not showing up due to other conflicting commitments. At first that worried me, but as a group we developed a way to combat that, through the recorded sessions. The team would allocate work to the missing member and decide as a group if it was a fair amount. 
		Overall, my reflection of the group work was positive and surprising to me. The effort members made to succeed on this assignment made for a dynamic, interesting journey. No one was left behind, meaning this group developed a strong assignment together.

		<h3>Matthew </h3>
		<p> 
		Once we had our first meeting and we got to meet each other and talk in a relaxed setting it defiantly helped settle the initial nervousness. We proceeded by quickly assigning tasks and roles, which became a great start for the success of our group. This then followed through as members were able to assist each other as well as move on to new tasks when they were able to, which I thought was excellent. I took on the task of group leader, though I was hesitant at first, I quickly took extraordinary pride in organizing as much I could for the group. I received some nice feedback about my organization skills which surprised me, and it was greatly appreciated. 
		At the start we did have some issues with attendance and there were also some technical issues with microphones and webcams, as we all had to get use to using Microsoft Teams. After the second meeting though this was resolved as we all gained the understanding of the importance that we all meet the expectations of each other, as well as the assignment requirements. Once some improvements to commination are made, I feel our group will be strong.  
		Overall, our group has been understanding, supportive, really nice and friendly, which has been great. I have learned working in a group can be challenging at times though people are generally kindhearted, so it is important to be patient and understanding.

		<h3>Yumna </h3>
		<p>
		She was initially concerned because she expected many members to miss meetings or having Trouble in communicating. She looked at her group members' websites before the first meeting and was really impressed and pleased with their creativity because she is a beginner and doing these things for the first time in her life so was a bit afraid before meeting them that they might not take her in their team because they all look professional and she might not participate the way they participate but after having a conversation with everyone she was relieved that all group members are incredibly supportive. During the first week, her group mate was working on a word document in teams, and she started a conversation with him live on that document, which was a surprising tool for her. In some meetings, she has noticed some members are not showing but active during chats, and members who are active in meetings cannot respond to chats frequently, including herself, due to working hours and in th		is area, she thinks we need some improvements. Overall, the experience is overwhelming, and all members are trying their hardest to give their best output, which is great as a team.

 		<h3>Niroshini</h3>  
		<p>
		Niroshini's first venture is working online as a group. The first meeting was exciting and broke all her fears about the group assignment. All the tasks were assigned according to our preference. Even though she had done her work on time, she did not know that it needed to update on MS team until the second meeting. Surprisingly, she could attend all the meetings despite her busy schedule and openness to others' opinions of her work. Moreover, she never thought that she could do well with the tool. 
		She is glad; she works with supportive, friendly, and selfless peers on her first group project. We were aware of the deadline and discussed it in every team meeting. As a result, No one was left behind, and there was no conflict. 
		It was a learning experience where the IT professional team member shared her knowledge about the actual work environment and guided us in professionally approaching things. Nevertheless, it would be great if all team members could have attended every meeting. However, our team spirit helped us to create a possible outcome. Niroshini's contribution to this group project was also satisfactory.

		<h3>Travis </h3> 
		<p>
		Everybody is super keen and willing to help each other out. We have all identified strengths and weaknesses and adjusted our approach to the assignment accordingly. Everyone has acknowledged each other's circumstances and as a team come up with a plan to work around them. He was concerned that he would not be able to keep up due to work commitments and worried that he would not be able to comprehend much of what was being taught, however he is grateful that there are like-minded people willing to assist. 
		He understands how important it is for a team to communicate and believes if there is any room for improvement with this team, it would only be that of communication, even if it is just to acknowledge what is being said. 
		What has surprised him is how quickly everyone fell into a role without any conflict. Normally he has seen conflict about who is doing what work and who will take up the position of leader, however this team did it seamlessly allowing us to crack on with what needs to be done. What he has taken away from working with this team is that everyone is motivated to see this through and produce quality work.

		<h3>Minnie</h3> 
		<p>
		She was concerned about group work at the beginning of the term as she will be the one who struggles to attend group meetings due to multiple existing commitments.  
		IT Roo's is deeply passionate, and goal orientated. They could delegate tasks and assist each other to achieve the best possible outcome for all.  
		All team members are creating an open-minded atmosphere that encourages each member to ask questions. Amazingly, there were no negative attitudes or refusal of delegated tasks. They were happy to try and showed a can-do attitude. 
		However, if we had more guidance from the school such as sharing real-world meeting templates. Because I assume we are aiming to be employed instead of being an entrepreneur of our own start-up businesses after this degree.  
		It was good to know each other's backgrounds, motivations, and passions. This is a good exercise for being able to work as a team to develop a website.

		<h2>Group Reflection </h2>
		<p>
		As our group reflects on our first group assignment it becomes obvious that there are many things that went well. All of us had many positive points of feedback which is a great start for us all on our IT journey. As our team got busy going through our tasks, soon we could all see that each one of us had been here to help and support each other. Whether it be lending a helping hand with tasks, providing and accepting positive criticism on work, supporting the group leader and team wide organizing. From the launch of our group all of us were completely understanding of each other's life circumstances and this also was never taken advantage of, as concerns were quickly resolved. Each member of our group is a nice kindhearted person and that is known by how respectful we all have been to one another. Most of us came into this group project being brand new to group work and all of us very easily took on the required roles and tasks, which shows amazing teamwork. This led to a lot of init		ial fears we may have had being overturned. Not only was this the first time many of us had worked on a group assignment, but it was also the first time most of us have had to utilize tools such as Microsoft Teams and Office 365 apps. Even though this was the case it was impressive how quickly we all adapted to the technologies.  
		Even the most experienced teams would not be without areas that could be improved, and the IT Roo’s are no different. Although all of us have shown that we are dedicated, passionate and goal orientated, we are situated across three time zones now that daylight savings time is here. Being this is our first assignment together, this extra consideration has presented only a couple of challenges that the group has commented on, which is where we need to make some improvements. These two areas are meeting attendance and communication in between our meetings.  
		Overall, our experience has been a good one. The willingness to help and support each other was a pleasant surprise to the group. We all agree that the effort everyone has made by their contribution has been impressive, the fact that everyone has been greatly positive and there has been no negativity whatsoever, this has also been a welcomed surprise.
